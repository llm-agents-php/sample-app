LLM Agents are advanced AI systems that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand, generate, and respond to
human language in a contextual manner. They are capable of maintaining conversational threads, adjusting tones, and
performing complex tasks like problem-solving, content creation, language translation, and more. Their use cases span
across industries such as customer service, education, and healthcare.

Key components of LLM Agents:

- **The Core**: Central processing unit that interprets inputs, applies reasoning, and decides actions.
- **Memory**: Stores interactions and data, enabling personalized and context-aware responses.
- **Tools**: Specialized workflows used for executing tasks such as querying information, coding, or performing complex
  functions.
- **Planning Module**: Enables strategic thinking, planning complex tasks, and optimizing long-term objectives.

The architecture includes:

- **LLM**: Neural network model that generates human-like text.
- **Integration Layer**: Allows communication with external systems (APIs, databases).
- **Input and Output Processing**: Enhances understanding through additional steps like sentiment analysis.
- **Ethical and Safety Layers**: Ensure appropriate, aligned, and safe responses.
- **User Interface**: Facilitates interaction through text, voice, or other mediums.

LLM Agents, though powerful, face limitations in understanding human emotions and are susceptible to risks such as
misinformation and bias. Prompts from users drive their actions, and with autonomous capabilities, they help reduce
menial tasks and solve complex problems efficiently.
